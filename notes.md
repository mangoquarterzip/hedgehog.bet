With covalent, should be made clearer in the docs that you have to include Bearer in the API key when making a request

swagger doesnt work

TO do list:

Create express js server, make rq to covalent for the address of window.ethereum, then display that as eligible NFTs to be used, also do for tokens, filter out scam tokens

create deploy page/open a hedge page

i need to get data[0]items[0]]nft_data[i]token_id[i]
